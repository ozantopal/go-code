Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:

> a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: true
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 5000]`.
- `-10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4`
